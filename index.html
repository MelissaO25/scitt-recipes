        <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
        <p>Shredded pork loaded fries are a hearty, flavorful dish that combines crispy fries with tender, slow-cooked pork.<br> The pork is typically seasoned with spices and cooked until it's fall-apart tender, then shredded into bite-sized pieces. Piled generously over a bed of hot, crispy fries, it creates a satisfying contrast of textures.
        </p>
        <p>To take these fries to the next level, they’re often topped with melted cheese, tangy barbecue sauce, jalapeños, and other toppings like sour cream, cilantro, or green onions. The result is a decadent, savory treat that’s perfect as a meal or appetizer, offering a delightful mix of flavors and richness in every bite.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the pork. <br>
                Set the pork roast in your slow cooker with liquid, cover, and set to high for 4 hours. <br>
                Once it’s fork tender, shred it into bite sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Do the prep work <br>
                Meanwhile, dice the bell pepper and slice the green onion. Wash and slice the potatoes into french fries, then set them in a bowl of cold water until you’re ready to use them. This keeps them from browning and also washes a bit of the potato starch off the outside of the fries, giving you a crispier fry. <br>
                Optionally, I like to quickly sauté the bell peppers in about 1/2 teaspoon of oil. You can use them raw if you’d like!</li>  
            <li>Air fry the potatoes <br>
                Preheat the air fryer. <br>
                Meanwhile, toss the potatoes with 2 Tablespoons of oil, salt and pepper. When cooking in the air fryer, it’s best to cook in batches, so that the basket doesn’t get too crowded. Fill the basket to about 1/3 of the way to the top with the potatoes. <br>
                Cook for about 17-20 minutes, stopping halfway through to shake the basket and rotate the placement of the fries.</li> 
            <li>Assemble & Serve <br>
                Transfer the fries to a large plate or sheet pan. Top with the shredded pork, bell peppers, bbq sauce, sliced green onions, and a dollop of sour cream, if using.</li>
